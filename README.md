To enable completion for your current file type, open one of the file and put your cursor in, open the Command Palette (cmd+shift+p or ctrl+shift+p), and run the: "Log Cursor Scope" command. This will trigger a notification which will contain a list of scopes. The first scope that's listed is the one you should add to the list of scopes in the settings for the package. Here are some examples: .source.gfm (markdown file), .text.plain (text file), .text.tex.latex (latex file).
